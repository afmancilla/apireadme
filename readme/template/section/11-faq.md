## FAQ

### Can I see how my README file is going to look before I commit it?

Yes you definitely can! There are lots of tools out there for editing/previewing Github flavored markdown. I recommend using [https://stackedit.io/app](https://stackedit.io/app) to preview the final result since it is super lightweight and does it job well.

### How can I get involved?

Create an issue or pull-request. You are also very welcome to throw me a message at [@AndreasMehlsen](https://twitter.com/andreasmehlsen).

### I already have a large README file - I don't have time to rewrite everything!

No problem at all! Your first step can be to rename your `README.md` to `blueprint.md` and run `[[ example.command ]]`. Already then your README should now be well-formatted. Then you can slowly replace the contents when you have time. The low-hanging fruit would be to add the table of contents and license using respectively the `{{ template:toc }}` and `{{ template:license }}` templates.

### How can I support you?

There are lot's of ways to support me! I would be so happy if you gave this repository a star, tweeted about it or told your friends about this little corner of the Internet ❤️
